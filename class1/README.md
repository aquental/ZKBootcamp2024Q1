## Maths Introduction

Some modular arithmetic

1. Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}

   What is

   a) 4 + 4 = **_2_**

   b) 3 x 5 = **_15//6_**

   c) what is the inverse of 3 ? : **_x_**

2. For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}

   Can we consider 'S' and the operation '+' to be a group ?

3. What is

   -13 mod 5 ?

4. Polynomials

   For the polynomial $x^{3}-x^{2}+4x-12$

   Find a the positive root ? **_x_**

   What is the degree of this polynomial ? **_3_**

## Use cases

In your teams discuss any systems you have used that involved zero knowledge proofs.

Have you seen any applications of zero knowledge proofs other than with a blockchain ?

What is to you, the most important feature of zkp technology ?

Think of some use cases of zero knowledge proofs that you would like to see developed.
